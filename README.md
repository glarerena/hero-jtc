# 🛠️ Capstone Merge Branch

This is the **staging branch** for our Capstone MVP project.

We will use this branch when the time comes to **combine everyone's code** into a single, testable version of the chatbot.

Please do **not push directly** to this branch unless you are handling an approved merge from your assigned branch.

## 🔁 Workflow

1. Each team member works only in their assigned branch.
2. When your code is ready, notify the lead for review.
3. Your branch will be merged into `merge` for integration testing.
4. After successful testing, we will push to `main`.

Let’s keep things clean and organized. 🚀
