# 🧪 Bloom-RAG LLM Hackathon Prototype – JTC Flagship Capstone Spring 2025

Welcome! This branch contains an early backend prototype created during the hackathon ideation phase of our Capstone project. It was built to test a single-turn chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with a locally hosted LLM.

This prototype was later removed from the `main` branch to keep the MVP scope focused but is preserved here for reference and potential future use during Phase 2 or 3.

## 📁 Included in This Prototype

- `bloom-rag/backend/`
  - `main.py` – Entry point for the local LLM backend server
  - `rag_chat.py`, `OG_rag_chat.py` – RAG logic for pulling static context
  - `debug_ami.py` – Optional debug/test module
  - `static/index.html` – Basic web interface for testing
  - `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies for the prototype

## 🔎 Branch Purpose

- This branch contains experimental work and is not part of the official MVP.
- The LLM code was developed quickly during the hackathon planning phase.
- It can be referenced or reused in later stages of the Capstone timeline.
